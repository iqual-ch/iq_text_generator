# iQual Text Generator
This module provides text generation features that can be used as widget for long text fields.
It relies on an external source to generate text outputs based on given context.

# Installation
Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. For further information, see [Installing Drupal Modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-modules). The core module of the iQual Text Generatpr itself does not provide any interfaces to data sources; they are all available via separate modules, install one of them or build a new one according to your project requirements.

## Configuration
This module provides a GUI to manage datasources. The GUI is available at "Configuration » Web Services » Text Generator".
